{\bf discover and act} on new customers and themselves

"ethnography": loaded word, not always describe what communicate

generic: not committing to methodology
there are best practices but always iterating and improving
discover and act

THEMSELVES: what's unspoken, unknown in own culutre
not vaccuum
something new or different built on starting point
anchor activity in who we are as a team
